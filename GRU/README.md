# Recurrent (GRU) Network Energy Disaggregator

An attempt to create a "lightweight" recurrent network for energy disaggregation. Moreover, this architecture supports predicting the energy consumptions of more than one meters.

See example experiment [here](https://github.com/OdysseasKr/neural-disaggregator/blob/master/GRU/GRU-example.ipynb).

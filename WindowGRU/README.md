# GRU with Sliding Window Disaggregator

A Recurrent Neural Network disaggregator that uses a window of data as input instead of one sample of the timeseries.

As described in [Sliding Window Approach for Online Energy Disaggregation Using Artificial Neural Networks](https://dl.acm.org/citation.cfm?id=3201011) by Krystalakos, Nalmpantis and Vrakas.

See example experiment [here](https://github.com/OdysseasKr/neural-disaggregator/blob/master/WindowGRU/Window-GRU-example.ipynb).

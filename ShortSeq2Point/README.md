# Short Sequence to Point Energy Disaggregator

Based on [Sequence-to-point learning with neural networks for nonintrusive load monitoring](https://arxiv.org/abs/1612.09106) by Zhang et al. Sequence-to-point learning with neural networks for nonintrusive load monitoring.

The main changes are the shorter window size as well as some dropout layers.

See example experiment [here](https://github.com/OdysseasKr/neural-disaggregator/blob/master/ShortSeq2Point/ShortSeq2Point-example.ipynb).
